                            Close your eyes. Open your heart. Take a deep breath.
                            What do you feel? A gentle touch of the breeze… Do you hear the silence? Not only around you
                            — but within. The quiet hush beyond the city, beyond endless thoughts.
                            And now — listen. The soft chirping of birds. The scent of wild herbs in the air. A deep
                            sense of calm. Life's rush stays far behind. You feel how your body lets go, how your mind
                            softens — filling with strength and energy, gifted by nature itself.

                            Just 155 kilometers from Athens and 17 kilometers from Fterolaka of Mount Parnassos, is the
                            most picturesque village in the area — Tithorea. Near the village of Tithorea, in the valley
                            of the Boeotian Kifissos, since 1911, on an area of 120 acres, our cozy eco farm family
                            hotel “Terra Nova” has taken root.

                            We are a warm family team: mom, dad, grandma, grandpa and two kids — a 9-year-old boy and a
                            2-year-old girl. Together we created a cozy eco-farm, where everything is filled with life,
                            care and simple joys.

                            Our farm is a place where you can relax your soul: wake up to the chirping of birds, feed
                            goats and chickens, or just drink tea under a tree. We welcome guests with children of any
                            age and those who travel with animals — we have enough space for both play and peace. We
                            invite you to visit, live and feel at home. It's easy to slow down here and remember how
                            beautiful simple things can be.

                            Tithorea is the center of the E-65 trail, next to the famous Kahalas gorge, where the
                            visitor has the opportunity to admire the old watermill "Ekklisia to Mylos", through a
                            magical route with many caves and rocks in various shapes.
                            Entering the village, on the left, there are remains of a wall from Hellenistic times that
                            protected the settlement. In ancient times, Tithorea was one of the most important cities of
                            Phocis with traces of habitation since 2000 BC. Its ancient wall from the 4th century BC and
                            its Castle, its privileged geographical position, made it the most powerful center of the
                            ancient era.
                            The city was destroyed twice and after its third reconstruction it acquired the beautiful
                            walls and the name Tithorea. Look for the small chapel of Agios Ioannis Theologos. It has
                            old frescoes but the highlight is the early Christian mosaics from the 3rd century BC. You
                            will see them under the illuminated glass floor.
                            Due to the simultaneous roughness and sweetness of its terrain, Odysseus Androutsos set up
                            his headquarters here, in his famous cave, which the locals call the Black Hole. It takes an
                            hour and a half to hike there.
                            Androutsos settled here with his mother, his wife Eleni, his sister, captains, a guard and
                            the English philhellene Trelawney who also brought small cannons from England. How did they
                            all fit in? Before settling in, Androutsos had craftsmen shape the cave, which had two bays,
                            in order to make living comfortable. It was Androutsos' base from 1822 to 1825. Many
                            treasure hunters passed through the Cave of Dysseas, as the residents of Tithorea called it.
                            Legends about hidden treasures by Androutsos still surround it.

What do you feel? A gentle touch of the breeze… Do you hear the silence? Not only around you — but within. The quiet hush beyond the city, beyond endless thoughts.
And now — listen. The soft chirping of birds. The scent of wild herbs in the air. A deep sense of calm. Life's rush stays far behind. You feel how your body lets go, how your mind softens — filling with strength and energy, gifted by nature itself.

Just 155 kilometers from Athens and 17 kilometers from Fterolaka of Mount Parnassos, is the most picturesque village in the area — Tithorea. Near the village of Tithorea, in the valley of the Boeotian Kifissos, since 1911, on an area of 120 acres, our cozy eco farm family hotel “Terra Nova” has taken root.`,

Our farm is a place where you can relax your soul: wake up to the chirping of birds, feed goats and chickens, or just drink tea under a tree. We welcome guests with children of any age and those who travel with animals — we have enough space for both play and peace. We invite you to visit, live and feel at home. It's easy to slow down here and remember how beautiful simple things can be.`,

Entering the village, on the left, there are remains of a wall from Hellenistic times that protected the settlement. In ancient times, Tithorea was one of the most important cities of Phocis with traces of habitation since 2000 BC. Its ancient wall from the 4th century BC and its Castle, its privileged geographical position, made it the most powerful center of the ancient era.
The city was destroyed twice and after its third reconstruction it acquired the beautiful walls and the name Tithorea. Look for the small chapel of Agios Ioannis Theologos. It has old frescoes but the highlight is the early Christian mosaics from the 3rd century BC. You will see them under the illuminated glass floor.
Due to the simultaneous roughness and sweetness of its terrain, Odysseus Androutsos set up his headquarters here, in his famous cave, which the locals call the Black Hole. It takes an hour and a half to hike there.
Androutsos settled here with his mother, his wife Eleni, his sister, captains, a guard and the English philhellene Trelawney who also brought small cannons from England. How did they all fit in? Before settling in, Androutsos had craftsmen shape the cave, which had two bays, in order to make living comfortable. It was Androutsos' base from 1822 to 1825. Many treasure hunters passed through the Cave of Dysseas, as the residents of Tithorea called it. Legends about hidden treasures by Androutsos still surround it.`,

Τι νιώθεις; Μια απαλή ανάσα του αέρα… Ακούς τη σιωπή; Όχι μόνο γύρω σου — αλλά και μέσα σου. Η ήρεμη γαλήνη πέρα από την πόλη, πέρα από τις ατέλειωτες σκέψεις.
Και τώρα — άκου. Το απαλό κελάηδημα των πουλιών. Το άρωμα των αγριόχορτων στον αέρα. Ένα βαθύ συναίσθημα γαλήνης. Ο ρυθμός της ζωής μένει μακριά. Νιώθεις πώς το σώμα χαλαρώνει, ο νους μαλακώνει — γεμίζοντας δύναμη και ενέργεια, δώρο της ίδιας της φύσης.

Κοντά στο χωριό, στην κοιλάδα του Βοιωτικού Κηφισού, από το 1911, σε έκταση 120 στρεμμάτων, έχει ριζώσει το ζεστό μας οικογενειακό αγρόκτημα-ξενοδοχείο “Terra Nova”.`,

Μπαίνοντας στο χωριό, αριστερά, σώζονται τμήματα τείχους ελληνιστικών χρόνων που προστάτευαν τον οικισμό. Στην αρχαιότητα, η Τιθορέα ήταν από τις σημαντικότερες πόλεις της Φωκίδας με ίχνη κατοίκησης από το 2000 π.Χ. Το αρχαίο της τείχος του 4ου αι. π.Χ. και το Κάστρο της, η προνομιούχα γεωγραφική της θέση, την κατέστησαν ισχυρό κέντρο της εποχής.
Η πόλη καταστράφηκε δύο φορές και μετά την τρίτη της ανοικοδόμηση απέκτησε τα όμορφα τείχη και το όνομα Τιθορέα. Αναζητήστε το μικρό παρεκκλήσι του Αγίου Ιωάννη του Θεολόγου. Έχει παλιές τοιχογραφίες, αλλά το πιο εντυπωσιακό είναι τα παλαιοχριστιανικά ψηφιδωτά του 3ου αι. π.Χ., ορατά κάτω από γυάλινο φωτιζόμενο δάπεδο.
Λόγω της ταυτόχρονης αγριάδας και γλυκύτητας του τοπίου, ο Οδυσσέας Ανδρούτσος έστησε εδώ το αρχηγείο του, στη διάσημη σπηλιά του, που οι ντόπιοι λένε «Μαύρη Τρύπα». Χρειάζεται περίπου μιάμιση ώρα πεζοπορία για να φτάσει κανείς.
Ο Ανδρούτσος εγκαταστάθηκε εδώ με τη μητέρα του, τη σύζυγό του Ελένη, την αδελφή του, καπεταναίους, φρουρά και τον Άγγλο φιλέλληνα Τρελώουνι, ο οποίος έφερε και μικρά κανόνια από την Αγγλία. Πώς χωρούσαν όλοι; Πριν εγκατασταθεί, τεχνίτες διαμόρφωσαν τη σπηλιά, που είχε δύο κόλπους, ώστε να γίνει κατάλληλη για διαμονή. Υπήρξε η βάση του Ανδρούτσου από το 1822 έως το 1825. Πολλοί κυνηγοί θησαυρών πέρασαν από τη «Σπηλιά του Δυσσέα», όπως την αποκαλούσαν οι κάτοικοι της Τιθορέας. Θρύλοι για κρυμμένους θησαυρούς του Ανδρούτσου τη συνοδεύουν ακόμη.`,
